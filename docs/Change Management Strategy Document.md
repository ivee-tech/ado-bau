# Executive Summary

## Change Initiative Overview

The Developer Velocity Planning initiative aims to establish a consistent Agile framework for Business As Usual (BAU) teams, transitioning from ad-hoc task management to structured sprint-based delivery. This change will impact team processes, tools, metrics, and daily working practices.

### Scope of Change
- **People**: 50+ team members across 8 BAU teams
- **Processes**: Sprint planning, backlog management, daily stand-ups, retrospectives
- **Technology**: Azure DevOps implementation, Power BI dashboards, Microsoft Teams integration
- **Culture**: Shift to collaborative, transparent, and accountable working style

### Expected Benefits
- **25% improvement** in delivery predictability
- **20% increase** in team productivity through better planning
- **40% reduction** in scope creep and rework
- **Enhanced stakeholder satisfaction** through improved visibility
- **Better work-life balance** through realistic capacity planning

## Change Management Approach

This strategy employs Kotter's 8-Step Process for Leading Change, adapted for Agile transformation in a BAU environment. The approach emphasizes gradual adoption, strong communication, and continuous support to ensure sustainable change.
