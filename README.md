# Azure DevOps BAU & Agile Adoption Toolkit

High-level toolkit to accelerate day-to-day (BAU) work in Azure DevOps and support lightweight Agile adoption. It includes PowerShell scripts to create and convert work items at scale, simple analyses for scope creep, and a set of concise guides, templates, and dashboards to help teams get started quickly.

## Whatâ€™s inside
- PowerShell scripts: bulk work item creation, examples/demos, scope creep utilities, and helpers to convert issues to support requests.
- Config files: `fields.json`, `workitemtypes.json` for mapping and item definitions.
- Guides & templates: action plans, sprint/backlog, change management, user story examples, workshop materials, and follow-up plans.
- Dashboards: Power BI reports for velocity and sprint stories.

## Quick start
- Review the guides to choose the flow you need (e.g., Sprint Planning and Backlog Management Guide).
- Use the example scripts (e.g., `Examples-WorkItemCreation.ps1`) as a starting point and adjust `fields.json` / `workitemtypes.json` as needed.
- Explore scope creep helpers (`scope-creep.ps1`, queries, and sample workbook) if you need lightweight tracking.

## Notes
- Scripts are provided as examples; validate in a test project before running at scale.
- See `LICENSE` for terms.
